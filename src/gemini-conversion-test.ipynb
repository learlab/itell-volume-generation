It begins with the Preamble, emphasizing self-government through the words 'We the People.' The Constitution organizes the federal government into three branches—Legislative, Executive, and Judicial—each with distinct powers, ensuring a separation of powers to prevent any single branch from becoming too powerful. It outlines federal powers, such as declaring war and printing money, and also defines powers reserved for state governments, including public safety and education. The Constitution can be changed through amendments, with the first ten known as the Bill of Rights, and a total of 27 amendments existing today. As the supreme law of the land, it mandates that everyone, including all levels of government, must follow its principles, upholding the rule of law. The Constitution was approved by the original 13 states, with New Hampshire being the ninth to ratify it in 1788.\",\n",
